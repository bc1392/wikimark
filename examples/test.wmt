[#1{Hello, World!}#1]

[:{
    Welcome to the first test of [*{WikiMark}*]! Did you know you can link to pages like [/"https://google.com"{Google}/]? Why write [;{~<strong~>test~</strong~>};] when you can write [;{~[!~{test~}!~]};]?
}:]

[:v{Better yet, you can compress the following code:}:]
[;;{~<!DOCTYPE html~>
~<html~>
    ~<head~>
        ~<title~>Test~</title~>
    ~</head~>
    ~<body~>
        ~<h1~>Hello, World!~</h1~>
        ~<p~>This is a test.~</p~>
    ~</body~>
~</html~>};;]
[:^v{Into something as simple as this:}:]
[;;{~[#1~{Hello, World!~}#1~]
~[:~{This is a test.~}:~]};;]

[:{
    This is a [!{test}!].
